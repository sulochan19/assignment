# 16. Imagine you are creating a Super Mario game. You need to define a
# class to represent Mario. What would it look like? If you aren't familiar
# with SuperMario, use your own favorite video or board game to model
# a player.

class Mario():
    def __init__(self):
        height=self.height
        width=self.width


    def move_forward(self):
        pass
    def move_backward(self):
        pass
    def jump(self):
        pass
